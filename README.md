# Spotify-ML-Fun

## Background

My main plan for this project is to experiment with Spotify's Web API. I plan to start pulling as much data as I can, without putting too many constraints on the type of data. With a large data set, I hope to practice implementing various Machine Learning algorithms. The variety of data will help me practice eliminating parts of datasets that are not similar.

## Main Files
* localhost_test.py is local server test file - Not in use
    * Contains basic information
* playground.py is the main file that I will be using.
	* Spotipy's library allows me to easily access public spotify data, with which I will perform my data analysis
    * Connected to Spotify's Web API through Spotipy library
        * All export calls are called within the file, terminal credential calls are not needed
